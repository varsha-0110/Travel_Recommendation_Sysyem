Developed a Travel and Tourism Recommendation System Using Machine Learning Python and Destination
Recommendation System Python.
Collected datasets from Kaggle.
Used Jupyter Notebook from Google Colab to run the program.

This project focuses on building a Travel and Tourism Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Python.
The system analyzes user preferences, such as past travel history, reviews, and interests, to recommend personalized
destinations. Using advanced recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, it
creates personalized suggestions for users. This project is perfect for enhancing the travel experience and is a great
application of data science in the tourism industry.
